<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The SNS website 
  (<a href="www.geo.uu.nl/SNS.html">www.geo.uu.nl/SNS</a>) - placed on the server of 
  the Faculty of Earth Sciences in Utrecht - has been officially launched December 
  20, 2001. We celebrated this memorable event with a few bottles of excellent 
  Italian wines (for the many connoisseurs within the SNS: Dolcetto d'Alba DOC 
  2000 from Icardi and Lagrein I Baldazzini DOC 200 from La Vis). In the choice 
  for Italian wine, the SNS gratefully acknowledges that the Italian nation is 
  the world's leading supplier of Neogene GSSPs. The website has been designed 
  with great skill and enthusiasm by our ex-Ph.D. student Joris Steenbrink who 
  recently finished a very interesting thesis on orbital signatures in late Neogene 
  lacustrine sediments from NW Greece (Geologica Ultraiectina no. 205, 2001). 
  The website includes a.o. the first electronic Newsletter (number 8, 2001). 
  Important news herein is that the bureau established two new working groups: 
  one for defining Tortonian and Serravallian GSSPs (chaired by Frits Hilgen) 
  and another for defining Langhian and Burdigalian GSSPs (chaired by Isabella 
  Raffi). Four potential Tortonian GSSP sections have now been identified, measured, 
  sampled and tuned to astronomical target curves, and a decision on which of 
  these will receive the golden spike is close. Only two potential Serravallian 
  GSSP sections have been identified. One of these is located on Malta and is 
  presently under study by several groups. Frits and myself were sampling here 
  beginning November together with Wout Krijgsman and two students being visited 
  by a 3 days lasting storm loaded with African dust; the responsible cyclonic 
  trough caused floodings and hundreds of casualties in Algeria. The designation 
  of Langhian and Burdigalian GSSPs is definitively a more complicated affair. 
  Continuous and essentially undisturbed sections with the potential for astronomical 
  tuning will be hard to find but I feel confident that Isabella and co-workers 
  will get their teeth into this matter.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Other important 
  news concerns the merging of the SNS and SQS (the INQUA Subcomission on Quaternary 
  Stratigraphy). The merging was proposed by the ICS and had much to do with the 
  ICS opinion to remove the antiquated name Quaternary from the Global Chronostratigraphic 
  Scale and to extend the definition of the Neogene in such a way that it includes 
  the Pleistocene and Holocene. The ICS proposal has since been accepted with 
  open arms by the INQUA. However, simple merging both subcommissions into a new 
  one having 2 chairmen and 40 voting members would have resulted in an unworkable 
  situation. We therefore proposed the ICS to disband the SQS and to transfer 
  their task to the present SNS. We further proposed to set up a new WG with maximally 
  5 voting members of the former SQS whose mandate is to evaluate the present 
  status of Pleistocene chronostratigraphy, to propose a formal chronostratigraphic 
  subdivision of the Pleistocene and to define related GSSPs.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The above proposal 
  has been accepted by the ICS and means that from now on the SNS is also responsible 
  for Pleistocene chronostratigraphy. The task of the new WG on Pleistocene chronostratigraphy 
  will not be easy and I am therefore very happy that our vice-president of the 
  SNS Davide Castradori is willing to chair this new WG.</font></p>

  a Merry Xmas and happy New Year!<br>
