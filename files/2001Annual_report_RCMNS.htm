  2001 ACTIVITIES OF THE REGIONAL COMMITTEE ON MEDITERRANEAN NEOGENE STRATIGRAPHY 
  </b> </font> </p>

  <b>Past events</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">During 2001, the 
  Committee has centred its activities on the following events:</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A) Field workshop 
  &quot;Continental versus Marine Badenian&quot;, in the scope of the HR3 interval 
  of the EEDEN Project: The Workshop was organised by the<br>
  Department of Geology and Paleontology, Fac. of Natural Sci., Comenius University; 
  the Slovak National Museum - Museum of Natural History; the Geological Institute: 
  the Slovak Academy of Sciences, and the Geological Survey of Slovak Republic 
  (Bratislava, Slovakia) and took place on June 5, and on September 3-4, 2001. 
  The main topic of the field workshop was biostratigraphy of the unique Badenian 
  localities rich in vertebrate fauna.<br>
  First workshop at June 5, 2001 was focused on marine sediments on the Late Badenian 
  lectotype locality Dev&iacute;nska Nov&aacute; Ves - Clay pit and Sandberg littoral 
  facies. This workshop attended 18 persons from the 5 European countries (6 Austria, 
  3 Hungary, 1 Italy, 2 Yugoslavia, and 6 Slovak Republic). <br>
  15 persons, mainly vertebrists, attended the September workshop from Austria, 
  Czech Republic, Slovak Republic and Ukraine. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">B) First International 
  Pliocene Workshop: This Workshop was organised by the Museum of Paleontology 
  of Estepona (M&aacute;laga, Spain) within the activities of its inauguration. 
  The Workshop took place on September 13-15, under the auspices of the RCMNS 
  and was attended by 50 participants. The purpose of the organisers was to establish 
  a state-of-the-art on several aspects of the Mediterranean and neighbouring 
  Pliocene (Portugal and SW Spain), especially those related to the paleontology 
  and biostratigraphy. Seventeen invited speakers from Spain, France, Italy, Portugal 
  gave a vision of their fields of research. The presence of several members of 
  the Executive Board on this event propitiates some informal meetings devoted 
  to forthcoming activities.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">C) Furthermore, 
  a working group under the theme &quot;Evolution of the Mediterranean-Atlantic 
  connections during the late Miocene&quot; (chairman: Wout Krijgsman) has been 
  formally constituted. It is participated by both European and Moroccan researchers 
  and a first main goal of the group is to carry out a drilling covering the Tortonian-Messinian 
  limit in Morocco.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Forthcoming 
  events</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Some activities 
  are being planned for 2002:</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A) A joint Workshop 
  RCMNS-EEDEN under the theme &quot;Paleogeography, Paleoenvironment and Paleoclimatic 
  changes in geologic history&quot; will take place in Bratislava (Slovak Republic) 
  on June 5-7, organised by Mikal Kovacs. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">B) An Interim Colloquium

  organised by Silvia Iaccarino.<br>
  </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">C) A second Interim 
  Colloquium under the tentative title &quot;Paleogeographic evolution of the 
  Western Mediterranean during the Mio-Pliocene&quot; is being planned to be held 
  in Estepona (Malaga, Spain) on September 2002, organised by researchers of Granada 
  University.</font></p>
