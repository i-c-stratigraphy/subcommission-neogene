<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Dear Prof. Zachariasse, 
  </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Here is a report 
  on activities of the Russian Neogene Commission for 2001.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Interdepartmental 
  Stratigraphic Committee of Russia has approved the new Neogene stratigraphic 
  schemes for West Siberia submitted by the Neogene Commission at its meeting 
  in February, Saint Petersburg. The schemes (11 regional schemes and the explanatory 
  note) were published in July.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A conference on 
  Neogene stratigraphy of Russia was held in April, Moscow. It was attended by 
  65 specialists. The conference discussed some variants of Neogene stratigraphic 
  schemes for Pontian-Caspian region. After some modifications are made, the schemes 
  will be submitted for approval.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In June-August, 
  field works were carried out to study Neogene sections of the Ciscaucasia, southern 
  Russian platform, Arctic, and Kamchatka. Special attention was paid to the European 
  Arctic. A group of Japanese specialists (K. Ogasawara and others) examined the 
  North Kamchatka sections.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A series of articles 
  devoted to the Russian Neogene has been published. They deal with mollusks, 
  foraminifers, radiolarians and diatoms of Kamchatka and Sakhalin, paleogeography 
  of the Pontian-Caspian region and Siberia, and others. A large monograph on 
  the Sakhalin Cenozoic is in press.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Sincerely yours,</font></p>
