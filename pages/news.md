### Ratification of the GSSP for the base of Langhian Stage and Middle Miocene Subseries 

The IUGS Executive Committee voted unanimously on 29 May 2023 to ratify the proposal by the Subcommission on Neogene Stratigraphy (SNS) for defining the GSSP of the base of the Langhian Stage (and Middle Miocene Subseries) of the Miocene Series and Neogene System in the Mediterranean Lower La Vedova Beach section (Ancona, Italy). 

In addition, Integrated Ocean Drilling Program (IODP) Site U1337 in the eastern equatorial Pacific was designated as Standard Auxiliary Boundary Stratotype (SABS) with the objective of directly linking the Langhian GSSP to the astronomically calibrated open ocean benthic foraminiferal stable isotope record and, hence, to the Earthâ€™s climate evolution.

The golden spike at the base of the Langhian Stage and Middle Miocene Subseries is added in the 2023/06 International Chronostratigraphic chart and in the Neogene GSSP Table.
