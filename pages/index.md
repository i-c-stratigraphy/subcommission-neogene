## About SNS

### Organization
The Subcommission on Neogene Stratigraphy (SNS) is part of the International Commission on Stratigraphy (ICS) of the International Union of Geological Sciences (IUGS). The SNS was founded in 1971 in Lyon - during the IV congress on Mediterranean Neogene Stratigraphy - by Professor Menner, chairman of the ICS.

### Board
<!-- The present SNS executive consists of Kenneth Miller (Chair, Rutgers State University of New Jersey, USA), and Elena Turco (Vice-Chair, University of Parma, Italy) & Marie-Pierre Aubry (Secretary, Rutgers, State University of New Jersey).-->
Please see the ICS' listing of Subcommission office holders for SNS:

### Regional committees and Working groups

The SNS is currently working to install one working group on defining the Burdigalian GSSP. The composition and chair of the working group will be decided upon in early 2025. The mandate of the working group is to propose a GSSP for this Lower Miocene stage and to place it in the current astronomically-calibrated time scale.
